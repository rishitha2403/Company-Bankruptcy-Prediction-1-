# Company Bankruptcy Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a company is likely to go bankrupt based on its financial indicators. The prediction framework integrates a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** and a **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)** classifier, leveraging the strengths of both models. The hybrid ensemble approach combines probabilistic inference and deep feature learning, achieving robust performance on an imbalanced dataset.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights into data patterns, feature correlations, and class imbalance.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Feature selection using ANOVA.
  - Oversampling the minority class using SMOTE.
  - Standardization of features for uniform scaling.
- **Model Architecture:**
  - DNN with 3 hidden layers and dropout for regularization.
  - GNB for probabilistic classification.
  - Ensemble approach using soft voting to combine predictions.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

## Dataset
- **Source:** `Train.csv`
- **Size:** 5,455 rows × 96 columns.
- **Target Variable:** `Bankrupt?` (Binary: 0 = Non-bankrupt, 1 = Bankrupt).
- **Class Distribution:**
  - Non-bankrupt: 5,301 (97.2%)
  - Bankrupt: 154 (2.8%)

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Feature Selection:**
   - Used ANOVA F-scores to select the top 30 features relevant to bankruptcy prediction.
2. **Handling Class Imbalance:**
   - Applied SMOTE to oversample the minority class in the training data.
3. **Standardization:**
   - Scaled features to have zero mean and unit variance using `StandardScaler`.

## Model Architecture
### Deep Neural Network (DNN)
- Input Layer: Takes selected features as input.
- Hidden Layers:
  - Layer 1: 256 neurons, ReLU activation, Batch Normalization, Dropout (50%).
  - Layer 2: 128 neurons, ReLU activation, Batch Normalization, Dropout (50%).
  - Layer 3: 64 neurons, ReLU activation, Batch Normalization, Dropout (40%).
- Output Layer: Single neuron with Sigmoid activation for binary classification.
- Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 0.0005).
- Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy.

### Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)
- Probabilistic model assuming feature independence.
- Calculates posterior probabilities using Gaussian likelihoods.

### Ensemble Approach
- Combined predictions from DNN and GNB using soft voting.
- Fine-tuned decision threshold to maximize F1-score.
